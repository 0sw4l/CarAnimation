## About 

From Google Direction Api we can got a poly line. A poline is a combiantion of Latitide and Longitude. I  iterate though all list of 
LatLong object and use ValueAnimator to animate movement. It is possible to get Latlong from server and move with the direction. Have plan to update this repository and lots of chance to upgrade this. Like Less the osilation while changing the point and smooth rotation. 

Pull request is welcome
